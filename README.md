# Udacity-course---Final-project

Hi fellow Student, Tutor, Evaluator!

I have finished the Front-End Web Dev course. It was a BIT of a challenge, especially JavaScript!!! I´ve learned a lot (thank you Julia & James & others), but still I think there is a looong way to go to become a developer. Anyway, being accepted to the Scholarship by Google&Udacity was a perfect start. Looking forward to the next level!

Please feel free to browse my final project and leave any comment. I´d appreciate a constructive critique.

Just one thing to point out - if anyone will come across a problem with the compatibility of the ColorPicker with different browsers, there is a link below to Spectrum. In my case, the color picker did not work in IE 11 & Safari 5.1.7. After adding the Spectrum to the project´s index.html file, it works just fine.

Hope it will help;-)
